## 3D Representation

The way of doing this is actually much easier than what most of
us might have thought. It turns out that drawing 3D shapes is as simple as applying transformations
on 2D shapes. The only problem we need to solve is then what the specific transformations we need
to construct.

We will call the 3D world our data model and
simply refer 2D world as screen or the plane of a screen.

### Scaling and translation

Same as in 2D, scaling refers to squeezing (apertar) and stretching (esticar) and translation refers to movement in space
without changing shape (sem alterar a forma). However, instead of two coordinates, we now have three coordinates to work
on, so instead of squeezing, stretching or moving in two possible directions, we will be squeezing,
stretching or moving our figure in three possible directions.
